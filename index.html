            List one food for every letter of the alphabet. Let me ask you complex questions about household appiances.
            Here is an example of the questions I could ask: <a href = "https://basicenglishspeaking.com/household-appliance/">

            Required homework: Learn about cooking. This includes house appliances and foods.
            Understand the following words: taste (sweet, sour, salty, etc.),
            ingredients (salt, pepper, chicken, spinach, etc.),
            cooking equipment (blender, pan, pot, fork, knife, etc.).
            <br>
            The reason I say "etc." is because I have listed the required words to learn for
            homework but if the student is interested and has time, they may learn more.
            <br><br>
            Just for fun homework: Using home appliances. Use a blender to make a smoothie.
            Here is a recipe I enjoy:
