        Homework

          Required homework: Learn about cooking. This includes house appliances and foods.
          Understand the following words: taste (sweet, sour, salty, etc.),
          ingredients (salt, pepper, chicken, spinach, etc.),
          cooking equipment (blender, pan, pot, fork, knife, etc.).

          homework but if the student is interested and has time, they may learn more.

          Here is a recipe I enjoy:
